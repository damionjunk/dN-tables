# dn Tables

Some minor code to generate dN random tables in PDF format for various OSR RPG use.
This is extremely basic for now, and for personal use, but a few people asked for the code so here it is.

## Usage

REPL for now, I'll add some command line stuff once I decide what options to have and what format the source data should be in.

## Example Output

[The PDF](/samples/d12example.pdf)

[The FULL pdf](/samples/family-weapons-tables.pdf)

![(d12) d4 Damage Weapons](/samples/d12example.png?raw=true "d12 table example")
