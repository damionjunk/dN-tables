# dn Tables

Some minor code to generate dN random tables in PDF format for various OSR RPG use.
This is extremely basic for now, and for personal use, but a few people asked for the code so here it is.

## Usage

REPL for now, I'll add some command line stuff once I decide what options to have and what format the source data should be in.
