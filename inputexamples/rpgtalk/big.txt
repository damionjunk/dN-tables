5. A wardrobe room with golem servants identical in shape to their owners wearing lavish outfits. They're ready to test poses, change outfits and demonstrate fashion. In their off-hours, they move around and silently imitate their masters without saying a word.

Thomas03/29/2019
8. An enormous conservatory, the size of a mansion itself, housing a wide assortment of flora and fauna from many regions across the world.  This independent ecosystem has survived by itself for decades and its native populations have been thriving and crossbreeding, potentially creating entirely new species.  Something here may be hungry... or may have gained sentience on its own.
DuneAught03/30/2019
9. Mush room. For enjoying porridges.
johnsonny03/30/2019
10. a room that is large enough to easily be a ballroom, but it's completely empty except for a cast-iron, claw-foot bathtub in the center. You can hear a slow drip.
cromlyngames03/30/2019
11. A long thin room that gets lower towards the door. The shelfs are full of shoes getting higher heeled as the ceiling rises. Towards the end of the room they are full prosthetic legs
AaronF (he/him)03/31/2019

O_Pimentinha (GMT -3)03/31/2019
15. A long-abandoned room filled with all kinds of mirrors, long and short, thin and wide, broken and ornate, where a known narcissist used to live.
There's dust and cobwebs all over the place, but if some visitor is curious enough, they'll find that all the faces of the mirrors are sparkling clean.
DuneAught03/31/2019
16. Max Head Room. Room to display the taxidermized head of deceased pet, Max.

This is it! You've finished the entire map, and now you just need a few encounter tables!

When crossing the Limbgod Desert, you come across... [d6]
1. Hungry sand velociraptors stalking the wastes.
   a. They are tearing apart a dead horse, a messenger lying bloody nearby.
   b. A brief rustle of sand heralds an explosion of claws and teeth from beneath the sand!
Turtle Hat (he/him)05/01/2019
2. A herd of hovering, enchanted obelisks are gathering around an old ruin, collecting coins for their magician masters
  a. They've just finished collecting coins from the ruins and are starting to wander away with their chambers filled with silver
  b. A beast has spooked them and they're beginning to stampede!
Void Worship [he/him]05/01/2019
3. A gigantic mechanical man, dead and half buried in the sands. A community seems to have begun forming around the colossus.
   a. They are a scrap market selling parts off of the mechanical man.

Adam Montana (he/they)05/01/2019

    a. and a beast awakening is already resting there.
    b. and there is are abandoned jugs of water. Who left them?
Occam vanRijn05/01/2019
5. Every time you crest the next ridge of dunes, you see what looks like an enormous inverted castle floating in the air—complete with flapping banners and soldiers on the battlements. Always dancing at the horizon, the shimmering sight of it seems to draw you closer...
a) ...but it’s nothing but an illusion—the mirage of a nearby stone pinnacle modified by magic to draw in the desperate and lost...
b) ...and it’s absolutely real—complete with a vengeful fae queen who considers this bit of desert to be hers alone, and demands payment to cross her lands
D43m0n05/01/2019
6. A merchant caravan that seems to be in distress. The contents of their scarab-carts spilled across the sand...
a) ...They will offer food and small treasures for help getting to the next settlement.
b) ...It's a trap! The caravan is a decoy for a group of mimics who spring forth from their resting place on the ground, froth spilling from their maws.
Tam05/01/2019
The edge of the desert, scrub, deep gullies and canyons -- aha, Rimwest Canyon. There's a spot for adventure! [d6]
Jalthir05/01/2019
1.) fancy seeing another party in these parts!
 a.) you have a nice chat, maybe find out a bit about their quest, but too much.
 b.) too bad it seems to be an awful day for them, they are trying to prevent one of their own from falling off a ridge.
Archleone05/01/2019
2. You make your way to the lowest region of the canyon, where you find a small, clear pool, shaded by withered, sun-bleached trees. You peer into the pool, wherein you see...
   a. The entrance to a cave. The entrance is dark, but something bright glints deep within its reaches.
   b. A skeletal reflection of yourself. As you stare, the flesh of your own hand begins to grow faint, revealing the bone beneath - and you feel an urge to reach out and skim the pool's clear waters. Hopefully a friend will draw you back, away from the pool. Someone? Anyone?
AaronF (he/him)05/01/2019
3. A sheriff and their posse pursue an escaped outlaw, and confront you on a bluff.
 a. They could use a hand tracking and bringing the outlaw to justice, in return for a small reward.
 b. Say, one of you looks an awful lot like the picture on the wanted poster...how about you come with us back to town, nice and quiet like?
Adam Montana (he/they)05/02/2019
4. A rainstorm approaches, causing the canyon to flood! you escape ...
   a. Into a side canyon with buildings carved into the side. what could they contain?
   b. On a log, carrying you down to wherever the water is going.
Turtle Hat (he/him)05/02/2019
5. Miners, digging out of the canyons and into the bright sun
  a. They have injured workers and are seeking help. What forced them to the surface?
  b. The miners aggressively guard their claim. What strange artifacts did they find?
cromlyngames05/03/2019
6. A landslide has scattered stones and boulders across the canyon. Most of them look somewhat bone shaped.

b) a lot of death here, concentrated by time. Whats that black tent on the crest?
Tam05/03/2019
The deep gullies and fissures give way into the massive Tesseract Falls. Far below the ancient city sprawls, but first you must navigate the path down! [d6]
Occam vanRijn05/03/2019
1. You pass a group of bodies hanging from tangled climbing gear, so desiccated and worn that it’s hard to identify them. Their packs seem full...
a) ...and they are, with imperishable supplies, useful gear, and scorpions.
b) ... and they are, with nothing but dozens of ranting journals full of dark suspicions and fear. Something in this canyon clouds minds...
just Sterbl05/03/2019
2. In the middle of a wide waterfall, an impossible sideways whirlpool sucks water deep into the cliff face.  From the black depths of the vortex...
a) ... warm firelight glinting off of golden treasure.
b) ... howls, shrieks and teeth.  It's alive and aware of you.
Archleone05/03/2019
3. While descending, you hear a scream coming from above, which you quickly realize is another adventurer - about to fall past you, to land in the jagged rocks below.
   a. You reach out your arm and attempt to catch them, hoping your strength and the equipment you've brought with you are enough to keep you both from plummeting.
   b. You say a quiet prayer and continue descending, until further below you see a bent and twisted form, dashed on the rocks. When you reach the cliff face, however, the body is gone. Then you begin to hear, from above, that same ghastly scream.
Turtle Hat (he/him)05/05/2019
4. Abandoned beasts of burden are tied to a dead tree near a tiny path up from the city. Their owners are not in sight
   a) It's a trap! Bandits lie in wait for the curious and well-meaning to take a closer look
   b) They beasts are laden with artifacts from the city and the scavengers who collected them are no where to be seen. You hear a cry for help in the distance!
DuneAught05/07/2019
5. There's a mysterious hole in the cliffside that light cannot penetrate. It looks bottomless, but a person could fit through.
  a.  Anything (or anyone) dropping through the hole gets spit out from another hole at the bottom of the waterfall. It's a one-way trip.
  b.  The hole is just a magically lightless cubbie. Within, there's someone's secret stash of valuable medicinal herbs and precious ever-glowing gems.
Adam Montana (he/they)05/08/2019
6.  Objects appear and disappear as they fall down the waterfalls, seemingly at random intervals.
   a. surely some could be useful if you could just reach out and grab them...
   b. they fall in your path, and who knows how touching them will turn out.
Tam05/08/2019
The ancient city of Workwyrm spreads below you. As you approach... [d6]
Occam vanRijn05/08/2019
1. ...you begin to feel watched. Five pairs of yellow, mirrored retinas flash from the shadows before disappearing the minute you turn to look. Some beasts are tracking you...
a) ...and they are still hungry after eating the last adventurers.
b) ...and they’re waiting until the monster ahead kills you to steal bits of your corpse.
just Sterbl05/08/2019
2. A chain carved from interlocking stone links grinds across the main road
a) it circles the city endlessly, the only working part of a long decayed trolley system.
b) at the end is a massive doglike gargoyle formed from living rock.
Archleone05/08/2019
3. As the city's epicentre comes into view, you see a massive, half-domed ampitheatre. On its steppes rest the coils of the titular Workwyrm. She seems engrossed with her latest Masterpiece.
   a. She is busily arranging a large statue composed of the weapons and armor of adventurers who wandered too close. It looks like it might come alive at any moment...
   b. She's conducting an Orchestra of chained and manacled bards. Their haunting melody is enchanting, and you feel an urge to get closer, to better appreciate the acoustics...
DuneAught05/08/2019
4. A fanfare of horns rings through the air.
  a.  It's an alarm. The city's being invaded by savage beasts.
  b.  It's the opening ceremony for the city's feast and festival week.
Turtle Hat (he/him)Last Monday at 10:44 PM
5. A marble-paved street in front of you is entirely devoid of life, doors or decoration
  a. This is an enchanted sentient street that must be befriended for the doors to show themselves
  b. A localized magical field kills all living things that remain in the street for more than a minute. Bandits are using it to rob unaware explorers
just SterblLast Tuesday at 8:47 AM
6. You walk towards the city for hours but don't seem to make any progress
a. When you glance behind you, the edge of the city is right there.  You've only traveled in about 100 yards.
b. The buildings are much larger than you guessed at first, like they were built for things 5 times larger than human.
TamLast Tuesday at 9:56 AM
You stand before the gates of Workwyrm; what do you encounter as you make your way through it? [d6]
𝔛𝔞𝔯𝔞𝔰 (he/they)Last Tuesday at 10:14 AM
1. You descend down stairs of enormous proportions, arduously climbing down steps many times your height. The stairs open up into...
a. A giant-sized trap with spikes the size of church spires.
b. A giant-sized taproom with preserved kegs of wine and beer large enough to supply a whole town
WithalwhereLast Tuesday at 10:27 AM
2. A kobold town flourishes here, burrowed into gateway all the way up to its keystone more than a hundred feet above the ground. You hear a commotion from...
a. a goblin festival. Food, drink, and colorful trinkets flow freely.
b. a goblin trial. You are surrounded by clamorous voices demanding you act as impartial arbiters.
DuneAughtLast Tuesday at 10:33 AM
3. Did you say the secret password?
  a.  What you said as you passed the gate was good enough. Welcome to Workwyrm. The city denizens are bustling with busywork.
  b.  What you said as you neared the gate was invalid for entry. The magic gate has teleported you elsewhere far away, according whatever it was that you were saying at the time.
Occam vanRijnLast Tuesday at 11:14 AM
4. The gate here is blown out at the base, with huge chunks dug out of the walls as though a massive bulk forced its way though leaving gouges in the stone ten feet deep and thirty feet wide. The ground here is disturbed for hundreds of yards within and without, with strange glassy spines lying in and around the deepest grooves--even high on the walls of the gates.

a. These are the feeler-hairs of the great Wyrm, coated in a glossy poison that drives mortal creatures into a frenzied panic at the slightest touch; the only hope for the sufferers is to tie them up while the toxin dissipates, and to pray no predator chances upon them.
b. The spines are rooted together into a subterranean whole that must span the entire town. It passes through stone, wood, and if you sleep on the ground, flesh and bone. They subsist on the leavings of the Wyrm, but would be happy to nourish themselves on you if you tarry too long.
ArchleoneLast Tuesday at 4:13 PM
5. When you've crossed the threshhold, you find yourself in the Workwyrm's well manicured gardens, full of splendorously trimmed topiaries and decadently hued floral arrangements. When you step onto the grass, however...
   a. The plants begin to attack you, showering you with sticky-sweet fruits, needle-like thorns, and razor-sharp petals.
   b. Every path you go down leads you deeper and deeper into a maze of hedges that seem to grow denser and taller with each twist and turn, until you believe you are well and truly lost.
Turtle Hat (he/him)Yesterday at 11:17 AM
6. A statue, honoring the mythic founders of Workwyrm stands proud before you. It glimmers in the dim light, almost seeming to move
  a. You notice a small shrine before the statue. The spirits said to inhabit the statue may be fickle today. What do you do?
  b. The statue is teeming with antler-adorned cultists in vibrant teal robes. They are dismantling the statue! What do you do?
DuneAughtYesterday at 11:37 AM
You access the sewers beneath Skunkdead Square, a labyrinthine network of tunnels and tubes; what do you smell down here? [d6]
Occam vanRijnYesterday at 11:49 AM
1. The cloying, sweet smell or rotting flesh is intense here, but there are strange notes of musk and ammonia that you can’t place. Occasionally, you see tiny hair-like worms writhing on the floor. Around the next bend you nearly topple into...
a) ...an enormous pit of wyrmspawn. Only one in twenty million will grow to adulthood, but they all eat like they’re the chosen one.
b) ...an enormous pit with a single wyrmspawn in it, the size of a horse. It has eaten its sibling-rivals and is now ready to eat you.
just SterblYesterday at 12:07 PM
2. An acrid breeze, then nothing.  You fear you've gone nose-blind but slowly you catch the faintest whiff of something you never realized was smellable before
 a. Emotions - your group's own confusion and surprise at first, then you pick up a fainter trace of something else's fear.
 b. Magic - some of your equipment reeks of it.  In the distance you hear something large snuffling and snorting and coming closer.
ArchleoneYesterday at 1:28 PM
3. The magic sensitive among you feel the pulse of... a summoning. Surging up the tunnels (and your nostrils) AN EXCREMENTAL! It takes the form of...
   a. A raging dire bear, enormous and unstoppable
   b. A stampede of dire boar, trampling and goring all in its path
Adam Montana (he/they)Yesterday at 1:32 PM
4: it smells surprisingly nice, like just baked cookies and the way it smelled when you visited friends when you were young.
   a. someone is living down here, and has made a home nearby.
   b. this cannot be so, and it must be an illusion.
