Tam03/28/2019
So, we're exploring The Dread Pit of Zeiram the Lich. What's guarding the front door? (d6)
1. A pair of copper warrior statues, trying the old "one of us lies, the other always tells the truth" thing, but they keep getting confused which is which.
Burch03/28/2019
2. A ghost who doesn't realise he's dead. He'll only let his granddaughter past in to the lair, but if you convince him he is indeed a ghost, or that you know his grandaughter, or that you are his grandaughter, he might change his tune.
Marcus03/28/2019
3. A solid stone or metal door inscribed with instructions to speak the password or insert the limb of your choice into the conveniently placed slot as payment. The door responds to nothing else.
Tam03/28/2019
4. Nothing, but when you step through the open door you find yourself back outside, only imperceptible to those who haven't yet passed through.
Helicity03/28/2019
5. A pile of what looks to be the skeletal remains of adventurers and their gear. Unfortunately this is a devious trap as all the items are cursed.
caiphon03/28/2019
6.  3d2 "zombies" - actually each dead body has been stuffed with two or more shades, causing the bodies to twitch and giving the appearance of undeath. Destroying the bodies releases the much deadlier shades from their fleshy imprisonment.
Tam03/28/2019
We're past the front door (somehow, probably lost some henchmen out there). What's the first thing we notice, sense, smell taste, etc. in here? (2d6)
Peter J03/28/2019
2. The torches in here are lit, but surely they must have burned out years ago...
Leadlight03/28/2019
3. You scan the poorly lit hall and note nothing of interest. Unbeknownst to you though there’s a slight crack on the side of the wall that’s leaking sulfur. Hey it’s pretty dark in here. Why don’t you light a torch and I’ll let you mark XP? :wink: (Is this how this works?)
Tam03/28/2019
Close, just label it "3" instead of -6, and then someone will do 4, and so on until we have a whole table!
Guycep03/28/2019
4. An onyx sphere atop a podium, a pounding headache, and a bitter taste in your mouths
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/28/2019
5 the  [Intoxicating] smell of belladonna coats the air , a low sussurus of ropes sliding against rope ,  a complex network of faded red ropes marking out an old spell constantly shifts and tries to reform around something missing it's center.
6.  A soft rainbow kaleidoscope of colors,  rows of intricately twisted cast iron form delicate but rusting  flowers, each petal glows,  where not rust coated, with a different pastel hue.  The scent of spring after the first thaw on a mountain valley wafts playfully past you. Faint calls of Robins and cardinals flit about the intimate welcome chamber.
Marcus03/28/2019
7. The distinct, acrid scent of burnt flesh.
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/28/2019
8 the slow steady turning of gear works gently vibrates through the air, the scent of old oil and leather assaults the nose,  the room is nearly empty save for a single wheel on the far wall slowly turning it's leather belt slapping loosely against the air  and one on the near wall still and unmoving.
Slothman03/28/2019
9. A copper bowl is held from the ceiling by 3 chains, and strange green smoke comes from within, scenting the air with a mixture of rotting flesh and fresh garlic.
Jaces (UTC-4)03/28/2019
10. Nothing. Nothing at all. Like, literally nothing. We're all suddenly completely devoid of all sensations- there is no odor, no taste to the air. Everything in our field of view is completely white (or is it black?). There are no audible sounds, and even the clothes on our back seem to have vanished- at least, we can't feel anything there.
Halsver03/28/2019
11. A great feast lies before you on a long stone table, the food looks delicious and the table setting inviting. A boisterous chatter fills the air as guests begin to file into the room from from all directions, taking their seats at the table. Once seated the conversations end and the ghostly figures look at you with hungry eyes.
Burch03/29/2019
12. A vase filled with freshly picked flowers, arranged with care. They've clearly been watered recently - who looks after them? The vase is the not entirely rotted head of a humanoid, mind, taking any of the comfort that may have been there from seeing the flowers.
HiveMindfullness03/29/2019
Remind me, what did Old Irontooth say gave him his scars? It was something down in the Dread Pit (1d6)
TatsumakiBOT03/29/2019
:up:  |  HiveMindfullness leveled up!

Peter J03/29/2019
1. The Elder Thing in the Pit controls the minds of its slaves. They don't want to leave, and any who manage to shake off the control and try to escape, the other thralls attack. Those scars on his body come from when he escaped, though Irontooth never talks about the scars the Elder Thing left on his mind.
Tam03/29/2019
2. There's a lizard thing down there, as big as a dragon, dead white and eyeless, but it can smell your greed and it has claws and fangs like sickles.
Halsver03/29/2019
3. Gfoughnn the Bound had a terrible habit of keeping track of time using other prisoners. Old Irontooth was lucky to be picked for counting the months, those picked to count the hours on rarely lasted a week.
caiphon03/29/2019
4. Ol' Irontooth claims it was some enormous, ancient, rusty machine, still spinning like mad and sharper than a bladeling's fingernail. Some gnoll myths about the pit offer corroboration - according to legend, the dread pit was made by an even worse dwarven war machine, the dreadful bore. Perhaps it's still down there...
Thomas03/29/2019
5. A great crevice opened up beneath him and the jagged rocks tore him up as he fell.
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/29/2019
6.   There be a wicked creature there all metal and gears a thing of the past still walking it's path an eternal guardian of an already stolen treasure.  Mindless it harms all who it sees, relentless it is and godwrought it must be for no sword nor spear can harm it.
~~~
The parties scale a winter shrouded mountain to the summit which holds the last temple to a near forgotten god of renewal and storms.  When they get to the top what do they see, taste, and hear? D6
Tam03/29/2019
Nooo, we're still exploring the pit!
We haven't even gotten to the treasure yet!
... meanwhile, the B-Team...
1. Lightning, fierce strikes of it, that taste like ozone and remind you of your worst nightmares. You can see one of those nightmares, now, in the corner of your eye.
Burch03/29/2019
2. Lightning rises in to the sky from the ground in the centre of an altar carved in to the top of the mountain An abomination made of lightning and static claws it's way out of the ground, arcing it's vaguely humanoid back in pain before it explodes, the electricity returning to the earth as it is grounded. You can feel the static on your fingertips and taste ozone.
Jaces (UTC-4)03/29/2019
3. They find themselves at the bottom of the very same mountain, their own footprints still visible in the snow.
Peter J03/29/2019
4. Eldritch gears and clockwork. Opening the way inside requires understanding how this advanced machinery works--and being able to harness the lightning storm overhead to power it.
Thomas03/29/2019
5. They feel the strength of the constant wind, the  bite of winter's chill, and the kiss of snowflakes melting on their exposed skin.  They hear the cry of eagles flying far overhead, only specs amongst the shining sun.  They see more mountains before them, though not as tall, and their destination beyond the mountains, within their reach yet yet still so far away.
caiphon03/29/2019
6. the taste of juniper berries - up here, in the eye of the storm, despite the snow, the mountain top is lush with small trees and flowering plants. A small grove by the temple door looks especially heavily-laden with tree fruit.
Burch03/29/2019
There's another faction at play in the Dread Pit who are currently neutral to you. Who are they, and why are they in the Lich's domain? (D6)
Tam03/29/2019
1. Erden the Rotting sought immortality and only achieved a sort of perpetual falling apart but not quite dying state. He's collected a few trinkets he's willing to sell and left quite a few pieces of himself in traps around the place.
caiphon03/29/2019
2. The Cobblescale Clan, the remnants of a clan of kobolds whose dragon was turned into a dracolich by Zeiram. They've snuck into his lair in search of revenge (and maybe restitution in the form of loot).
Thomas03/29/2019
3. A group of colonists have decided that this is the perfect place to build their new village.  Children play in the streets while their parents erect dwellings and plant crops.  Maybe they have some spare food or supplies?
caiphon03/29/2019
4. The crew of the Accretion Disk, a ship of the celestial sea that somehow crash landed underground in the prime material. The captain, a Dust elemental, has gone missing, and the dimensional alignment matrix appears to have been deliberately tampered with. They've hunkered down for repairs, but will begin sending out search parties soon.
Leadlight03/29/2019
5. The Unchained Dead, when the rival necromancer, Grimfall, released some the rotting horde of the lich from their bondage he also returned their sense of identity and free will. They’re not very trusting of outsiders, but perhaps you can gain their confidence?
Slothman03/29/2019
6: The soul vampires. A group of strange outsiders to our world, holding items and powers beyond comprehension. They are willing to trade this power...how much is your soul worth to you?
The dread pit holds many treasures and rewards, some beyond your wildest dreams. When you leave the pit victorious, what treasure do you find, and how is it going to betray you in the end? (D6)
Thomas03/30/2019
1. A friend!  They were a prisoner of the lich, subject to torture and experimentation.  You freed them and together you fought your way to victory.  Now you've forged a strong bond and they follow you in your adventures.  But neither of you know about the lingering effects inflicted by the lich's dark powers, and how they are slowly corrupting your new friend...
Burch03/30/2019
2. A sword with a blade the size of a surfboard that the lich fought with using their undead strength. It absorbs the soul of whoever it kills. The lich was using the souls for power - issue is, now they're just accumalating with nowhere to go, and that's going to cause a problem.
Helicity03/30/2019
3. The Lich's Grand Grimoire.
This massive tome is almost two feet tall and bound in iron and suspicious leather.
It contains centuries worth of dark knowledge and spellcraft.
But the Lich was no fool, many of the written formulas contain intentional errors to bring ruin on would-be thieves.
Peter J03/30/2019
4. The lich's alchemy lab has all kinds of rare and useful reagents and apparatus, just waiting for a new owner. There's even his notes on how to become a lich yourself...
caiphon03/30/2019
5. An enchanted necklace, with a set of 3d4 long, white chalcedony crystals, carved to look like bones. When you break a crystal and then point at a creature, a jet black beam of energy erupts from your finger and breaks a bone of the creature you pointed at (the bone you pointed towards). When the last crystal is broken, several of the wearer's bones break (chosen randomly by the GM).
Burch03/30/2019
6. The lich had a familiar who's soul is trapped within a glass orb. It paces from one side to the other impatiently like a caged tiger, taking whatever form it fancies. It has a wealth of knowledge, but it surely holds a grudge against you killing its master.
---
Welcome to the build-a-lich workshop! Zeiram the Lich rules the Dread Pit. If our adventurers are successful, Zeiram's mortal form will perish, but their soul cannot be killed until their phylactery is destroyed. What form does their phylactery take, and why is destroying it a difficult task? (2d6)
caiphon03/30/2019
2. One of the many teeth of "Toothy", Zeiram's reanimated Tyrannosaurus Rex, housed in the pit's menagerie.
Peter J03/30/2019
3. The phylactery is the heirloom weapon of the party warrior. Zeiram was his ancestor.
Helicity03/30/2019
4. The phylactery isn't here. Or more accurately it isn't now.
Burch03/30/2019
5. The phylactery is a loved one of one of the party members. The lich puts his soul in to a new body every time a host dies, and he had divine enough of the future to predict that this form woukd be useful.
Zarynthine03/30/2019
6. Zeiram's phylactery is the Dread Pit itself.  The entire dungeon must be destroyed in order to bring him to his final death.  Of course, the Pit has plenty of adventurers inside it as raw materials for him to begin rebuilding...
--
Zeiram's death has triggered a contingency spell, transporting the players to a dangerous new locale.  Where is it, and what dangers immediately threaten the party?
Helicity03/30/2019
1. A sweltering jungle...of giant mushrooms. Over head looms a giant red moon in a pitch black sky, bathing the area in an unwholesome crimson light.
Tam03/30/2019
2. A vast cavern, with fleshy walls, filled with a lake of bubbling green acid. The skeleton of a massive snake lies half-submerged in the middle, beneath dozens of bat-winged shapes hanging from the ceiling. You feel a sense of motion.
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/30/2019
3. The top of a zigguraut made of fiercely cold blue ice that stands in the middle of a desert where the sand occasionally catches fire.
Leadlight03/30/2019
4. A vast sprawling building filled with non-Euclidean architecture. All sense of orientation is lost as your mind attempts make sense of the world around you.
caiphon03/30/2019
(is the phylactery still a 2d6 table? should we go 7-12?)
Tam03/30/2019
Let's do the last two on this one and then go back to it.
5. The heart of your old village, but everything is weathered and dirty. It's been exactly fifty years since you last set foot here.
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/30/2019
6.  Placed on a goblin flotilla enroute to invade your kingdom.




------
7 Zeriam ''s. Phalactery  is a clockwork mouse that must be disassembled to destroy it.  The mouse is made of seven different clockwork gears each made of a different metal.  Each gear holds a riddle written in an ever shifting script until someone speaks aloud the secret whispered to the gear by a different criminal who went to their grave unpunished for their crimes.   Once the secrets are all spoke and the riddles each answered then seven different blacksmiths must place the clockwork mouse in their forge for a day and a night to destroy a gear each.
Thomas03/30/2019
8. The phalactery is a child's doll, modest and worn.  Why was this doll so significant to the lich?
cromlyngames03/31/2019
9. The phylactery is a battered pile of papers inscribed with the rules of this world and lost in another plane
caiphon03/31/2019
10. The phylactery is the city Adelma, on the coast. Back when the city was founded, Zeiram became the city's patron, and a powerful ritual has bound Zeiram's soul to every building and living thing in the city.
Thomas03/31/2019
11. The phylactery is a large, glowing amythest embedded within the body of the lich's undead lieutenant... and it's getting away!  Quick, after it!
screbuts03/31/2019
12. He found a way to bound his soul not to an object, but to a more social construct. The foundation of democracy in the land is keeping him alive. Although the gods did not foresee someone bending their rules like that they are determined to allow this construct to also stand as a phylactery.
Tam03/31/2019
Far above the Pit, on the mountain in a temple of a lightning god, the adventurers have finally breached the altar. What lingering curse awaits those who touch it? d66 (36)
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/31/2019
1.  The first through are cursed with a voice that booms like thunder.
ExtantLily (GMT+8)03/31/2019
2. Those that pray at the altar have the lingering power of the god course through their veins - the discharges of static electricity from their fingers are now lethal - they may never again know the touch of another without fatal consequences
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/31/2019
3.  The act of desecration angers the last eternal servant of the forgotten diety,  a storm elemental will follow them all the rest of their days. Tormenting them by killing all they love but never killing them.
ExtantLily (GMT+8)03/31/2019
4. Anyone who touches the altar has their hair supercharged and turned into a fabulous afro
O_Pimentinha (GMT -3)03/31/2019
5. Those who touch the altar will suffer from sporadic and sudden lightning-fast and paralizing flashes of visions, from the past or future? who knows..
Thomas03/31/2019
1-6. Whenever those who are cursed are caught in bad weather, the god strikes them:  in a rainstorm, they will be struck by bolts of lightning; in a blizzard, their bodies will begin to freeze into cubes of ice; in a heat wave, their clothes will ignite; etc.
ExtantLily (GMT+8)03/31/2019
21. They become magnetized and start attracting all metal into the vicinity towards them - this is a passive, uncontrollable effect.
Tam03/31/2019
2-2. An inability to ever tell the truth again, courtesy of the cultists who infiltrated and defaced the altar in an attempt to summon their mad god.
Thomas03/31/2019
( @ExtantLily (GMT+8) @Tam Aren't those supposed to be 2-1 and 2-2 ?)
Tam03/31/2019
No biggie. I am pre-coffee.
ExtantLily (GMT+8)03/31/2019
oh mb
Burch03/31/2019
2-3. Their source of sustenance is changed from food and drink to electricity - once a week or once a month (GM's choice) they must be hit by a lightning bolt to continue living, or a similar discharge of electricity.
Peter J03/31/2019
2-4. The weather steadily changes around them if they remain still for any long period of time. After a week in the same location, it becomes overcast until they leave. After two weeks, it becomes non-stop rain. Three weeks, non-stop thunderstorms.
Thomas03/31/2019
2-5. Every few minutes you have the sudden urge to sneeze, and every time you almost do, but not quite.
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)03/31/2019
2-6
The last place you sleep will always be struck by lightning in the next storm in the area.
Burch03/31/2019
3-1. You can speak the language of electricity. You can understand what static, sparks and lightning bolts think and say - the issue is that this is usually hellbent screaming due to their incredibly short lived lives.
caiphon03/31/2019
3-2: A howling wind accompanies them wherever they go, even inside and deep underground; the wind is always loud and cold, making stealth and travel difficult at the very least.
Thomas03/31/2019
3-3. You, and all your travelling companions, and teleported to a strange and unfamiliar place.  Maybe it's a prison, and you have to free yourselves.  Maybe it's a puzzle, and you have to solve it to return home.  Or maybe it's a hostile realm, and you must fight for your lives.
caiphon03/31/2019
3-4. Every time you meet someone new, a short, unpleasant shock of electricity jumps from you to them. It's never lethal, but it is guaranteed to make a terrible first impression
Peter J03/31/2019
3-5. The thunder that comes after lightning means something. Now you know what--and it knows you know.
caiphon04/01/2019
3-6. You're followed by a significant storm of blue lightning - an interplanar signal marking you as anathema to the gods and their servants.
Burch04/01/2019
4-1. Your teeth are replaced by fingers of comparable length, each of which has exactly one knuckle and finger nails which need as much maintenance as your original ones.
Halsver04/01/2019
4-2. A vision appears of an ancient monk, who sat upon this peak long before the altar. His eyes open and a piercing light shoots straight trough you! You know something, something important. Maybe the right question will bring this knowledge out of your subconscious...
Thomas04/01/2019
4-3. There's a never-ending song playing in your head, and you just can't stop dancing to it!  Sure, you can still talk, and run around, and swing your sword, but you can't do any of it without also waving your arms, spinning around, or doing the splits once in a while.
----------
4-4. You are voraciously hungry all the time.  Unless stopped, you consume all available rations within minutes.  If no food is immediately available, you go wandering off to find some, even if that means separating yourself from your companions or putting yourself in an obviously dangerous situation.  You'll eat anything that looks remotely edible, even if it's rotting or poisoned.
----------
4-5. You are now a fanatical follower of the god.  You regularly shout praises to the god, including at the worst possible times, and find ways to discuss your devotion to the god in your everyday conversations.  You constantly try to convert others around you to worshippers of the god and become aggressively hostile against anyone who says anything negative about the god.  During your downtime, you seek to celebrate the god by writing hymns, crafting statues, or undertaking other endeavors, even if you're not very good at doing it.
Helicity04/02/2019
4-6 whenever you stay in any location for more than a day, a terrible lightning storm begins to gather, the storm worsens day by day until floods and lighting strikes lay waste to the entire area after 3 days. When you leave the area the storm dissipates in a few hours.
Burch04/02/2019
5-1. You can only speak in rhyming couplets, and all language to you becomes intelligible unless it is delivered to you in rhyming couplets. Half-rhymes are on thin ice.
Halsver04/02/2019
5-2. Salt, you need it. You need it now and you need to eat it frequently. If you go without salt for more than a few hours all of your muscles begin to cramp, a day and you fall unconscious. Though you may now drink saltwater as if it were fresh.
Burch04/02/2019
5-3. You have become an earth rod. Whenever there is lightning, from storms or otherwise, it heads straight for you. Your resistances and vulnerability to lightning is not affected in any way - good luck navigating a storm!
Halsver04/02/2019
5-4. Somewhere, far from here, was an object sitting upon an identical altar. This altar imbued you with a magnetism that is drawing the object ever closer to you. Roll 3 d6, one die represents the weight, one die represents the acceleration, and the last die is how many hours until it collides with you. You choose which die is which.
caiphon04/02/2019
5-5. The God of Storms died, and the path of succession is unclear. By approaching the altar, the players have indicated that they would like to make a claim on the divine portfolio. Unsuccessful claimants are usually disposed of by the eventual deity as a matter of course.
5-6. The Altar was cursed by the God of Storm's long time rival, the Goddess of Good Weather. The curse was meant as a prank for deific beings, so its strength is tuned a little high for mortals - roll on the table again, and double the effect of the result.
Tam04/02/2019
Six more entries!
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)04/02/2019
6-1

A simple curse awaits, each is branded by Lichtenberg figures across their faces. When they die, their body will cause an apocalyptic thunderstorm those who die in the storm will be used as fuel to bring the god back from the void.
Marcus04/02/2019
6-2. Every time you touch something metallic you receive a static shock. It's strong enough to cause you to jerk back in pain (likely with a curse), but not enough to do any actual damage.
6-3. you receive an unmistakable mark in a highly visible location (face, hands, or similar) that unmistakably marks you as a servant of the lightning god, for better or worse. What's more the God will actually treat you as his servant, issuing commands on a whim and threatening grave punishments if you fail to comply.
Leadlight04/02/2019
6-4 Those foolish enough to touch the altar are made Holy by the altar itself as it transforms their body into a living conduit to the Planes of Thunder. They find their flesh begins to randomly spark and jolt as the scent of ozone constantly follows them. Their skin will eventually slough off to reveal that beneath they are becoming pure Holy lightning.
caiphon04/02/2019
6-5 the bodies of those afflicted this way evaporate in bright sunlight, and become part of the local water cycle. They are trapped as clouds until the next precipitation, whereupon they are brought back to earth and can become corporeal again.
Torin_Blood (GMT-6)04/02/2019
6-6
